## About the Project

The Work Session Timer is an advanced version of the Pomodoro Timer built using Python’s Tkinter library.
It allows users to set custom work time, short break time, and long break time through a popup form before starting the timer.

Once the user enters the times, the app:
- Runs the timer automatically
- Switches between work, short break, and long break
- Tracks the session count
- Displays ✔ marks for every completed work session
- Provides a clean and visually appealing UI

This project helps understand:
- Timer scheduling using window.after()
- Tkinter GUI windows, popups, and blocking modal dialogs
- Dynamic UI state handling
- Input validation and safe user inputs
- Clean separation of timer logic and UI updates
